\begin{abstract}
In the nearly 20 years since Cirac and Zoller demonstrated that laser-cooled ions confined to a linear trap could be used to implement quantum gates, ion trapping has proven to be a suitable platform for practical quantum computation \cite{Cirac}. It didn't take long to show that each of the main DiVincenzo criteria (excluding those concerning flying qubits) can be satisfied by trapped ion systems, including single-qubit and multi-qubit gates \cite{Bruzewicz}. Long trap lifetimes and internal-state coherence, along with strong interactions between ions, make it possible to achieve control and measurement with extremely high fidelity. At this point in time, the largest hurdle facing trapped ion quantum computing (and most other paradigms) is scalability, with some of the most advanced models being comprised of tens of qubits \cite{Moses}. In this paper, I will explore the use of 2D Coulomb crystals of trapped ions for increasing the scale of future quantum processors \cite{Kato, Kiesenhofer}.
